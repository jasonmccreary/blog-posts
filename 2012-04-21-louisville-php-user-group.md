***Update**: The Louisville PHP User Group is now on [Meetup.com][1]. Join the group for future updates.*

For years I have looked for a Louisville PHP User Group. As Louisville is primarily a .NET town, my hopes for PHP have never been high. Unfortunately the Louisville tech community doesn&rsquo;t cross pollinate. Nonetheless, I have come across several developers and shops over the years using PHP. So there *is* PHP in Louisville.

> If you want something done, do it yourself.

So I&rsquo;m starting the Louisville PHP User Group. The first meetup will mostly be a meet and greet. We&rsquo;ll vote on a group name. Something catchy like *LouPUG* or *PHINKY*. I&rsquo;ll also provide a brief recap from attending [PHP|tek][2] the week before. And of course they&rsquo;ll be PHP swag.

The proposed schedule is to meet the last Wednesday of the month. Details for our first meetup are below. Please [comment][3] with your interest and help us spread the word.
