I&rsquo;ll be speaking at the [2011 WordCamp Louisville][1] this Saturday, October 1st. This will be my third time speaking at WordCamp and second time for this talk – [Configuring WordPress for Multiple Environments][2]. I gave this talk as well as moderated two *unconference* sessions in June at [WordCamp Chicago][3]. It was a very rewarding experience and I look forward to speaking again.

Here&rsquo;s the talk synopsis:

> WordPress boasts a &ldquo;5 minute install&rdquo;. This is great for simple sites running only in a production environment. But if you&rsquo;re using WordPress as a development platform or following a software development life cycle things become a little tricky. This talk will cover ways to migrate WordPress between different environments smoothly, including: code, database, and environment specific tasks. Although some aspects of the talk may be advanced, there will be demos, code samples, and time for Q&A. So if you use WordPress in more than just production, this talk&rsquo;s for you.

In addition, [VIA Studio][4] (my day job) will be the title sponsor for WordCamp Louisville. So I&rsquo;m also running a &ldquo;Genius Bar&rdquo; with my team. We&rsquo;ll be available to answer any user or development questions you may have about WordPress. I know I go to a conference hungry for answers to very specific questions. Hopefully this WordPress &ldquo;Genius Bar&rdquo; provides that, and of course drums up some business. 

[Register for WordCamp Louisville][5]. It&rsquo;s only 15 bucks!
