**Conditions**: *High 60s, Sunny*  
**Distance**: *18 miles*

We dug deep today for 18. We&rsquo;re calling it *Beast Mode*. The young group of thru-hikers arrived at camp late last night. Like me, they hoped to hike to Tray Mountain shelter but ran out of time and energy. This morning I banded together with them to get back on schedule – Plumorchard shelter. It would be an all day 18 mile hike with over 4,000ft of elevation change.

The plan was worth it for a few reasons. First &ldquo;Sidewinder&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beast&rdquo; (father/son group from [Day 3][1]) were stopping at the Georgia/North Carolina border. I needed more miles. So I needed a new group. Second, something about being on schedule keeps your mind right. One less concern on the trail. Finally, I wanted to know what high miles felt like.

Hard. I was constantly eating and using the electrolyte mixes. When you push that hard food equals energy. And you&rsquo;re using every bit. I ate a huge lunch. It was the first time I was close to feeling full. I snacked often. But shortly after each, I&rsquo;d hit a wall. In the real world, you rarely think of food as *energy*. Normally it&rsquo;s a ritual. Something you do at noon or the evening. On the trail, you skip a meal and your setting yourself up for exhaustion.

I caught up to the guys from the younger group at the last road crossing in Georgia. There was another 3 miles with some elevation change. Relative to the day it was nothing. Yet, it was also the end of the day. I had already gone 15 miles over similar elevation to [Day 2][2]. 15 miles is normally as far as I go in a day. I told the guys I&rsquo;d like to hike with them the rest of the way if they were willing. They let me take point and set the pace. We hit the shelter a little after 8:00pm. It took all day. With the exception of a few short breaks, I&rsquo;d been hiking since 9:00am. Given my state and the time, I opted to sleep in the shelter. It&rsquo;s saves time both at night and in the morning. I may regret it, most are critter invested. Right before bed, &ldquo;Red Fox&rdquo; came hollering into camp.

There was some trail drama today. &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo;, the girl from the younger group, was having serious knee pain. At lunch, &ldquo;Red Fox&rdquo; decided to wait for her. He had an eventful day yesterday. He left his mess kit in the back of the pickup when they hitch-hiked into Helen. He had gone on a solo mission to get it back. &ldquo;Red Fox&rdquo; rolled into Cheese Factory around midnight boasting his 31 mile day. Today he wasn&rsquo;t boasting. He hurt. So waiting for &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; also meant a break for him. In the end, &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; went into town to get her knee checked out at the next road crossing. &ldquo;Red Fox&rdquo; high tailed it to catch up with the remainder of his group.

Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll cross into North Carolina. Now that I&rsquo;m back on schedule it&rsquo;ll be a 16.5 mile day. North Carolina maintains a higher elevation. So their peaks are taller. Standing Indian Mountain tomorrow is 5,500ft. The highest on the trail so far. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll feel fine in the morning. I chose a heartier dinner – Spicy Sausage Pasta. A small comfort. &ldquo;Runner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; were at the same shelter. They offered some vitamins targeting joint pain. Between that and a good night sleep, I&rsquo;ll make the miles tomorrow. I have to.
