I have been on contract for the past 15 months, but it is time to move on. So I search for jobs. Submitting my resume. Going to interviews. Competing. Given the current economy, I wondered if it might be difficult. However, I wasn&rsquo;t *really* concerned.

Why not?

First, the technical industry runs its own course, potentially immune to economic trends. That is to say technology, in some fashion, is always in demand. Whether I must become a Java developer, web developer, or iPhone developer, development work exists for me.

Second, from past experience, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate in finding work. I&rsquo;ve been told I "interview well" and possess a "solid skill set". Furthermore, I noticed that regardless of title I don&rsquo;t see this in developers around me. Now I live and work in Louisville, Kentucky. So admittedly this isn&rsquo;t a technology mecca. Nonetheless, I do consider myself a *good developer*. I believe two underlying qualities keep me ahead of the rest.

## A good developer learns

This can be summarized in the quote, <q>"If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"</q>. Very few things are built purely using a single tool. So although it&rsquo;s great that you know every Java Class by heart, it doesn&rsquo;t help for iPhone Development. You need more tools in your toolkit. Although knowledge transference can save the day, a good developer will tinker with other technologies and at least become familiar. In doing so, they can call upon this knowledge when presented with something different.

In practice, I make an effort to visit technical blogs weekly, read one technical book a quarter, and learn one new language a year. If budget and timing align, I also attend a conference. This may sound like a lot or a little. Yet it&rsquo;s a small investment for the dividends it *will* pay.

## A good developer is passionately engaged

There are a lot of developer stereotypes. One of the largest being anti-social behavior. As much as we may want to code undisturbed, in the dark, with the soft glow of our screens, that won&rsquo;t do. I worked alongside a very *bright* developer that could rock out a Perl script without even looking up from the keyboard. I worked with other developers that sat through a requirements meeting, then went off and developed their own. That&rsquo;s not *good*. A good developer is engaged. They want to know more about the project. They *must* know more, because they care to *do it right*.

In practice, I ask questions in meetings and provide alternate solutions. No assumptions. Sometimes this doesn&rsquo;t win me any points. But, I have yet to see where this failed to help. In addition, when I hit that "coders-wall", I get up. I go talk with my co-developers. Most of the time, it gets me past my wall. Even if not, I am socializing. To me, this lends to a healthy, arguably more productive, development environment.

## Be a good developer

A developer with these two qualities is a good developer. They possess the fundamental elements to continually forge ahead using any technology while collaborating with those around them. In the [proper environments][1], a good developer could become a rockstar â€“ being that key piece to success.
