I recently gave my talk *Practicing YAGNI* at ZendCon 2016. I had previously given this talk at Laracon US 2016, which went well.

However, attendees wanted to see more code. So for this iteration of my talk, I spent more time discussing how the code evolves while practicing YAGNI.

You can read [Practicing YAGNI in Code](http://humana-io.cf.humana.com/articles/practicing-yagni/) on the Humana DEC blog. If you are new to YAGNI, I recommend reading my initial article [Practicing YAGNI](/2016/08/practicing-yagni/) first.
