Almost four years ago I started the [Louisville PHP User Group](/2012/04/louisville-php-user-group/). Which has since evolved into the [Louisville Software Engineering Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Software-Engineering/). I started this group not only to share my experience, but to learn about others experiences as well.

About a year ago, I started mentoring at [Code Louisville](http://www.codelouisville.org). They offer 12-week programs for anyone interested in learning to program. I've found as a teacher you can learn just as much as the student.

Around the same time, I also took a job on an [extreme programming team](/2015/05/two-weeks-extreme-programming/). Since then I have pair programmed with another developer every workday from 8 to 5. This one to one, peer to peer interaction has made me realize I'm missing an entire audience.

So, while I plan to continue speaking and mentoring, starting today I will offer personal coaching.

The format is simple: one-hour sessions sold in sets of 3 (for $279) or 10 (for $899).

Coaching focuses are:

- PHP
- JavaScript
- Objective-C
- Test Driven Development
- Git
- RESTful APIs
- or just starting programming

So whether you want to learning a new language, level up, or just get another developer's opinion, email me at <a href="m&#97;ilto&#58;c%&#54;&#70;&#97;%&#54;3hing&#64;%70&#117;%7&#50;%65&#99;oncepts&#46;&#37;6E&#101;&#37;&#55;&#52;">co&#97;chin&#103;&#64;pur&#101;conc&#101;pt&#115;&#46;ne&#116;</a>.
