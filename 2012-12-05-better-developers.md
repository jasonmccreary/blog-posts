During a lunch discussion on programming languages a co-worker made the notorious argument:

> &ldquo;[certain language] developers are better developers.&rdquo;

I generalized the argument because I&rsquo;ve heard it before. We all have. Fill in the blank with any [fashionable language][1] – Scala, Ruby, Go, Python…

This argument quickly degrades into a language debate. One filled with feature comparison and syntactical analysis to demonstrate superiority. Why? Well, let&rsquo;s face it – developers can be elitist when it comes to *their* language.

I also generalized to keep the focus off *[certain language]* and focus on the *developer*. I want to evaluate this argument objectively. And if I said, *&ldquo;PHP developers are better developers&rdquo;* you would have dumped core. Which proves the point.

From this argument, I propose the following, implied premises:

*   *[certain language]* is a fashionable language.
*   The developer learned *[certain language]*.

Applying the [Law of Syllogism][2]:

> Developers that learn fashionable languages are better developers.

This becomes a much more acceptable argument.

As recommended in [*The Pragmatic Programmer*][3], you should learn a new programming language every year. This being a [routine of a good developer][4]. One I personally follow. The purpose is to learn something new from each language. In turn making you a better developer.

So next time you hear, *&ldquo;[certain language] developers are *better developers&rdquo;*, consider the developer. It might just be valid.</p>
