From the Bible, the Tower of Babel, was intended to "reach the heavens". The result of an achievement of a united humanity. God, seeing what the people were doing, gave each person a different language to confuse them and scattered the people throughout the earth. From [dictionary.com][1], *babel* is *"a scene of noise and confusion"*. By analogy, this is what the world came to be a scattered, diversified place. The Fallout of Babel now radiates from everything and keeps humanity from achieving greatness.

## A United Front

As a developer, I know over a dozen languages – C, Java, Perl, PHP, Ruby, ColdFusion… I&rsquo;ve wondered why there are so many. Understandably technology evolves like anything else, and languages must be updated or replaced. But are each necessary?

Let&rsquo;s look at it from the another angle. Similar to the original storyline, consider the capabilities of a united development community. Think of development using a single language, independent of hardware or medium. Platform and compatibility become non-issues. It&rsquo;s like an open-source dream. How quickly could your projects be completed if they used a singular technology. How much could be shared? How quickly could we learn?

## Is it just a dream?

Of course this reaches much farther than just the development community. Imagine the world at large using a unified language. (there are even variations of sign language.. psht!)

One could argue that such a world would lack competition. Competition that drives us to excel. Again, this is just conjecture. Be that as it may, I would argue in return that we may excel at a greater pace united.

I don&rsquo;t know how we could get there, even just at a development community. Yet, I believe that united effort has great potential. I can&rsquo;t explain why we haven&rsquo;t achieved some variation of the. Maybe we just all seek to stand out. However, is this an inherit human quality or a pressure of society.
