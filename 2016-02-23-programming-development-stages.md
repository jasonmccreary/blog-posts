A few months ago I started mentoring for [Code Louisville](http://www.codelouisville.org/) - an organization offering free programming courses. After nearly 20 years developing, I had forgotten some of the struggles of starting out. I tried to reflect on the different developmental milestones a programmer reaches as their skills grow.

## Infancy
You're just starting out. The world of `1` and `0` is new and harsh. Everything is a challenge. You're thirst for the motherboards milk keeps you going. But if you don't get the nourishment you need, you won't survive.

## Childhood
You've learned enough to tie your own `for` loops. Now you're able to go out and play. You discover new things. You tinker. You want to do everything yourself - who needs that third party library anyway. You're still *young* and as such make silly mistakes. Sometimes you'll try to hide them as you know there's more to learn.

## Adolescence
You're coming into your own. You've learned enough to think you're invincible. You think you can do things in *5 minutes*. You obsess over the minutia and constantly look at your code in the mirror. You think your way is *cool* and anything else is not. Let's face it, you're a programming punk.

## Adulthood
At some point you grow up enough to realize a few things.

1. There is nothing *cool* about complexity.
2. You don't have to build everything yourself.
3. Helping those around you grow is part of personal growth.
4. You lead by [Boy Scouting](http://jason.pureconcepts.net/2015/01/are-you-a-boy-scout/).
5. Shipped is better than perfect.

In the end, a well-developed programmer possess traits from all stages. They maintain their hunger and passion from early years balanced by knowledge gained in later years.
