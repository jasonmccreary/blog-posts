For the last 3 years I answered the *call for papers* of various PHP conferences. All around the country. Submitting all sorts of talks. All rejected.

This morning I received an email with the following subject line:

> Jason McCreary: php[world] talk proposals accepted!

To which I replied:

> Fuck yeah!

I'm honored that not one, but two of my talks were accepted for the inaugural [php[world] conference](http://world.phparch.com) this November in Washington D.C.

The [two talks](http://world.phparch.com/speakers/#28440) are *From CakePHP to Laravel* and the latest iteration of my previous talk - [21 ways to make WordPress fast](http://jason.pureconcepts.net/2012/08/21-ways-wordpress-fast/).

This has been a goal of mine for some time. I look forward to seeing my fellow PHP developers at php[world].
