description: A story from my childhood explaining why I don't give money to bums.
---
After recent trips to New York, San Francisco, and Chicago I remembered a story from my childhood.

Walking the streets of any big city you&rsquo;re bound to cross paths with a bum. Now I know, *bum* is politically incorrect. But please continuing reading.

I always feel bad when they ask for money. I used to want to give them something. But I don&rsquo;t and it isn't because I never have cash.

When I was a kid, I remember being out with my Mom and saw a bum. Cardboard sign and all. I told my Mom I felt bad for him. My Mom said, &ldquo;You have money, go help him.&rdquo;

I did have money. A crisp $10 bill from cutting the lawn. So I went over, &ldquo;Here Mister!&rdquo;, and gave him my $10. Little *Jashon* making a difference. I was so proud.

That *bum* pulled a roll of bills from his pocket, wrapped my $10, and put it back in his pocket. No acknowledgment. No &ldquo;Thanks&ldquo;. He just turned around and kept begging.

So I don&rsquo;t give money to bums. That *bum* ruined it for everyone.
