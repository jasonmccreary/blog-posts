description: A story from my childhood explaining why I don't give money to bums.
---
After recent trips to New York and Chicago I remembered a story from my childhood.

Walking the streets of any big city you&rsquo;re bound to cross paths with a bum. Of course they ask for money. I always feel bad. I used to want to give them something. But I don&rsquo;t and it&rsquo;s not just because I never have cash.

When I was a kid, I remember being out with my Mom and saw a bum. Cardboard sign and all. I told my Mom I felt bad for him. My Mom said, &ldquo;You have money, go help him.&rdquo;

I did have money. A $10 bill from a freshly cut lawn. So I went over. &ldquo;Here Mister!&rdquo; and spotted him a $10. Little *Jashon* making a difference. I was so proud.

That *bum* pulled a wad of bills from his pocket, wrapped my $10, and put it back in his pocket. No &ldquo;Thanks &ldquo;. He turned around and kept begging.

So I don&rsquo;t give money to *bums*. He ruined it for everyone.
