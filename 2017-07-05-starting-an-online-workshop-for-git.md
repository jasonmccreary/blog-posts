A few years ago I helped a development team switch from SVN to Git. I was responsible for converting over 100 repositories to Git, establishing a workflow, and training the team. The first two were actually the easiest. The [Shrek blog post](https://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git) and [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) helped convert the repositories and for 99% of projects [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (or master/feature) is the workflow to follow.

The third task - *training the team on Git* - proved to be the most challenging. Not because there's such a steep learning curve, but because everyone was using a different tool. I found teaching developers to **use Git from the command line** provided a strong foundation. The developers then applied this understanding to their own tool.

These developers became empowered by Git. I realized although Git is a tool most developers use everyday, it's the one we know the least. I have been on a journey to empower more developers - by training, [writing posts](https://jason.pureconcepts.net/category/git/), speaking at conferences, [recoding videos](https://gettinggit.com), and now [hosting an online workshop](https://gettinggit.com/online-workshop).

I provided the backstory because it's important to understand this is not something I am *just doing*. There was a long road that lead me here. An online workshop requires a format, schedule, and attendees. I'd like to share the plan for my own workshop not only for feedback, but breadcrumbs for anyone else thinking of hosting an online workshop.

## The format
A few months ago I spoke at [Laracon Online](https://laracon.net/). It was my first virtual conference as both an attendee and speaker. I was pretty impressed. I felt their format worked. I reached out to the organizer to see if he felt the same. He did. So why change a good thing? I adopted their format and will use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) to stream live to attendees and [Slack](https://slack.com/) for attendees to communicate.

## The schedule
Since I have lead Git workshops at conferences I had a rough schedule. I adapted it slightly for a virtual workshop - adding more breaks and designated time for questions. The workshop would be four 1 hour sessions followed by 15 minutes for questions and a 15 minute break. During which time attendees can *mingle* in Slack. This also gives me an opportunity to answer any remaining questions in Slack and prepare for the next session. Take a minute to [view the full schedule](https://gettinggit.com/online-workshop#schedule).

## The attendees
This is the hard part. It's not as easy as *if you build it the will come*. Initially my goal was 100 attendees. I emailed attendees for my previous workshops talks and video subscribers. I barely made it half way to my goal. I considered cancelling the workshop. Then I thought maybe this first one will be small, but it's something I can grow over time. After all, developers are continually learning Git.

So if you're learning Git or want to improve your understanding I hope to see you virtually on July 19th for the first ["Getting Git" Online Workshop](https://gettinggit.com/online-workshop). Or if you're considering hosting your own online workshop feel free to send me your questions.
