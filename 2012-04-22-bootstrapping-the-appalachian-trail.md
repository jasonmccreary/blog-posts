In May I will set out on a 14 day, 206 mile hike through the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail, continuing on to Tennessee. I will be dropped off at the southern trailhead – Springer Mountain, Georgia. I plan to journal each day. When able, I will post my entries under [Appalachian Trail][1].

I labeled this trek *Bootstrapping*. Both for the hiking hyperbole and the computer reference – *a successive process that evolves a base program*.

I will do this alone. For me. To find more of myself. Nature as my catalyst.

My feet will carry me. Hiking as much as 18 miles a day. Lugging 35 lbs of gear. Crossing mountains and creeks. Rain or shine.

Once on the trail, there is one simple bearing – *North*.
