From inception I planned to open [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com) to developers. However, I first wanted to prove Shift was something Laravel developers would use. After the Laravel 5.3 release in August, Shift appeared to be growing organically.

Next, I wanted to see how easily another developer -- unfamiliar with the platform -- could build a Shift. So I did a pilot with [Bobby Bouwmann](https://twitter.com/bobbybouwmann) and [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) to develop the Lumen and Laravel Package Shifts.

Now I'm ready -- and excited -- to announce the *Shift Developer Platform*.

## Will you still build Shifts?
I will always build the core *Laravel Shifts*. But it's clear from feedback there are more Shifts to build than I have time for. So, I'd prefer to focus on the core and allow developers to build Shifts.

## What Shifts can I build?
Anything that would *convert*, *transform*, or *upgrade* the codebase of a Laravel project. This includes Laravel, Laravel Packages, and Lumen as well as components of the Laravel framework, such as Vue.js.

Examples range from micro-Shifts that convert *Filters* to *Middleware* or [routes to the new fluent syntax](https://twitter.com/tillkruss/status/812492561172467712) to larger Shifts that upgrade code related to a Laravel Package or lint the codebase for best practices.

## Can I charge for my Shift?
The *Shift Developer Platform* will support both paid and free Shifts. Inline with other app development platforms, revenue from Shifts will be split 70/30. 70% for the developer, 30% for Shift to cover payment processing fees, server costs, and support.

## How do I become a Shift developer?
The *beta* for the *Shift Developer Platform* will launch in February. You can [enroll to become a Shift Developer](https://laravelshift.com/shift-developer-platform) so you have early access to the platform as it's available.
