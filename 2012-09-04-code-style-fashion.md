description: While talking about technology trends, I heard an interesting analogy - the difference between fashion & style as it relates to code.

In a recent interview I hung out with the team after hours. An interesting conversation started with one of their engineers ([not developer][1]). We were talking about current technologies. He related this to fashion and style. I thought this was an insightful analogy and wanted to share.

Fashion is the latest trend &mdash; *in vogue*. Technologies such as Ruby on Rails might have been high-fashion a few years ago or NoSQL now. These technologies advocated by diehard evangelists. After all fashion is not without passion. It's hip and cool and *you should do it.*

An interesting quality of fashion is that it moves in cycles. Upon closer inspection these technologies are not new. Merely new faces of old technology. [MVC][2] from the 1970s. [NoSQL][3] from the 1990s.

Style is more lasting. More personal. This is the way we write our code &mdash; format, naming conventions, procedural vs. object-oriented. All become our *coding style*.

We may identify with new fashion and choose to incorporated pieces into our style. Say the descriptive (arguably long) method names common in Objective-C. Although we may not write Objective-C, we can adopt similar method naming when writing PHP code.

In the end, one must balance both fashion and style. Not enough fashion and you risk stagnation. Your style becoming *behind the times*. Too much fashion and you may be too cutting edge. A victim of the [hype curve][4].

This post resulted from a conversation with Jeremy McEntire. He presented the *Fashion vs. Style* analogy.
