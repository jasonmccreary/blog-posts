description: A list of books culled over the years on the journey to improve my craft as a software engineer.
---
A few years ago I continued my journey to become a true [software engineer](http://jason.pureconcepts.net/2012/08/developer-vs-engineer/). I interviewed with big tech names and worked with brilliant people. Along the way, I asked for ways to improve my craft.

The following is the intersection of a long list of books. It has been culled through cross-reference and repeated recommendation. I call this *The Reading List*. Some believe it's what every software engineer must read.
