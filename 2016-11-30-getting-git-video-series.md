Over the last 5 years I've helped companies migrate from SVN to Git, trained teams on using Git, and spoken at conferences about Git. The one thing I see each time is developers feel empowered once they learn Git.

The issue is that at first I didn't *really* learn Git. I just memorized a handful of commands, like `git add` and `git commit`. Or, worse yet, I used an [evil wizard](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/wizards) to manage Git for me.

This meant whenever there was a problem I got stuck. I resorted to silly things like making backup files and recloning the repository to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. When all else failed, I would ask my coworker Richard (the resident *Git master*) to fix it for me.

The problem is not everyone has a Richard (no pun). Or maybe you are the Richard of your team (again, no pun) and want to remain the *Git master*.

Either way, I decided to turn my talks and training materials into a video series I'm calling *"Getting Git"*. Currently I have outlined **over 40 videos**, which I will continue to add to even after the initial release.

The format is simple - **No evil wizards**. We will learn Git from the **command line**. Each command will be covered in two videos: the basic usage followed by more advanced usages.

My goal is to release the introductory videos in the next few weeks, with an *early access* by end of year.

***Update:** The [Getting Git](https://gettinggit.com) website is now available. Head there for the latest updates.*
