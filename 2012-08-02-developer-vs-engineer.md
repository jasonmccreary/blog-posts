description: After interviewing with some top tech companies, I realized the difference between a developer and an engineer.

I recently returned to the job market with the fortune to interview with some top tech companies. I noticed the usage of *Developer* and *Engineer* in job titles. While I typically agree with &ldquo;titles don&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;, there is a difference between the roles of *developer* and *engineer*.

## Developer

A developer executes. Their talents often focused to a single area. Without need for the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo;.

## Engineer

An engineer designs and plans. Always aware of the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo;. With talents in many areas. An engineer can assume the developer role. But an engineer&rsquo;s core focus lies with architecture.

This is not a judgement on either role. Simply a distinction I&rsquo;ve come to realize between the two. An important one personally, as I intend for my next role to be an *engineer*.
