My CakePHP project fell down a rabbit hole earlier over something in hindsight was a no-brainer. I created a custom `app_controller.php` and `app_model.php` in my app directory. I copied the respective files from `cake/libs/controller` and `cake/libs/model`. I added my customizations and refreshed the page. *Nothing.* I checked the filenames and output a few `debug()` calls. *Still nothing.* I added `beforeFilter()` with just an `echo`. *Nothing!* My controllers and models weren&rsquo;t inheriting any of the custom parent methods. Finally, it hit me â€“ **clear the cache**. *It worked.*

Maybe that is a rookie mistake. Nonetheless, hopefully that saves someone the 15 minutes I lost. Clearing the cache was actually the solution to a problem a few months back. Which is actually the only reason I tried it. So when in doubt with CakePHP, clear the cache.
