I'll be speaking at [WordCamp Chicago 2012][1] later this month. This will be my fourth time speaking at WordCamp and first time giving this new talk – *21 Ways to Make WordPress Fast*. As WordPress powers 20% of the web, I have wanted to give this talk for some time now. WordPress sites are notoriously slow. Yet there are a whole set of optimizations to make WordPress fast. More than I could cover in a single talk. Nonetheless, these 21 ways will give cover the main optimizations and help you make your WordPress sites faster.

Here's my talk synopsis:

> We all know WordPress is slow out of the box. This talk provides 21 ways to make WordPress faster. We'll start with basic theme optimizations and work our way up to server configurations. There's something for everyone. So if you want your WordPress site to load faster and handle hundreds of requests per second, don't miss this talk.

So [come to WordCamp Chicago][2]. And for those that can't make it, look for a follow-up post at the end of August.
