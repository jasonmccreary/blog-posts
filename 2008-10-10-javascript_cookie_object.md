I have been using [Prototype][1] for the last year. I am still relatively new, but so far it does everything I need it to do natively. I have build many reusable scripts that do everything from adding simple events to automatic front-end form validation. With additional visual effects by the partnering [Scriptaculous][2] library, there isn't much left. That is until I came across the need for front-end cookie management.

### Why Front-End Cookie Management

As a back-end programmer, front-end cookie management seems silly. Why would I need or want to use something like JavaScript to manage cookies. Until recently, I would have just used PHP or Ruby for the job. However, I have found myself on contract as Lead Front-End developer. As such, those technologies are not available to me. Furthermore, tasking someone down on the IT side of the house can be a time consuming hassle. And came you blame them? I'm able to reverse the roles, and if some marketing guy asked me to set up a cookie to store XYZ, I'd laugh. Rightly so too, why should I waste such time storing things like text size, toggled modules, etc on the back-end. After all, aren't such examples why cookies exist. User settings or preferences may necessitate back-end involvement, and these can be stored in a cookie for convenience. Yet, something dealing with the UI doesn't really warrant involvement.

### Where's the Cookie Monster

So the obvious choice to manage cookies on front-end is JavaScript. During research, I came across two interesting pages. The first was a collection of [Top 10 JavaScripts][3], with the top being cookie management functions ported from PHP. Second was a JavaScript class called [CookieJar][4]. At first, I didn't quite understand the point. See to JavaScript the cookie comes across as a simple key value pair as semi-colon separate string in `document.cookie`. If you want to track several variables, you would need to set as many cookies. That would get oldâ€¦ err stale. Anyway, instead of having all these cookies floating around, the JavaScript CookieJar organized then for you.

### Enter Prototype

CookieJar was a little primitive. The premise, to store the variables as a hash in a single cookie, was sound. But it didn't actually handle cookie storage. Now this may be kitchen for the Object Oriented elitists, but I merged the two scripts. To regain some ground, I wanted my Cookie class to be a Singleton Gateway. As such, it should do everything required to access, manage, and maintain the Cookie. Since I was already using Prototype, I took advantage of its Hash object. I ended up with the script below.

    var Cookie = {
      data: {},
      options: {expires: 1, domain: "", path: "", secure: false},
    
    init: function(options, data) {
      Cookie.options = Object.extend(Cookie.options, options || {});
    
      var payload = Cookie.retrieve();
            if(payload) {
                Cookie.data = payload.evalJSON();
            }
            else {
                Cookie.data = data || {};
            }
            Cookie.store();
        },
        getData: function(key) {
            return Cookie.data[key];
        },
        setData: function(key, value) {
            Cookie.data[key] = value;
            Cookie.store();
        },
        removeData: function(key) {
            delete Cookie.data[key];
            Cookie.store();
        },
        retrieve: function() {
            var start = document.cookie.indexOf(Cookie.options.name + "=");
    
            if(start == -1) {
                return null;
            }
            if(Cookie.options.name != document.cookie.substr(start, Cookie.options.name.length)) {
                return null;
            }
    
            var len = start + Cookie.options.name.length + 1;   
            var end = document.cookie.indexOf(';', len);
    
            if(end == -1) {
                end = document.cookie.length;
            } 
            return unescape(document.cookie.substring(len, end));
        },
        store: function() {
            var expires = '';
    
            if (Cookie.options.expires) {
                var today = new Date();
                expires = Cookie.options.expires * 86400000;
                expires = ';expires=' + new Date(today.getTime() + expires);
            }
    
            document.cookie = Cookie.options.name + '=' + escape(Object.toJSON(Cookie.data)) + Cookie.getOptions() + expires;
        },
        erase: function() {
            document.cookie = Cookie.options.name + '=' + Cookie.getOptions() + ';expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT';
        },
        getOptions: function() {
            return (Cookie.options.path ? ';path=' + Cookie.options.path : '') + (Cookie.options.domain ? ';domain=' + Cookie.options.domain : '') + (Cookie.options.secure ? ';secure' : '');      
        }
    };
    

### Example Usage

Currently, the Cookie class only handles a single named cookie. This is acceptable since you can store multiple variables in a single cookie. However, I want to refactor this class from a Singleton to a Factory. Look for that in the future. In the meantime, here are some current sample uses:

Cookie that expires 90 days from visit, and sets a value:

    Cookie.init({name: 'yourdata', expires: 90});
    Cookie.setData('favorites', false);
    

Cookie that only lasts the session, with default data:

    Cookie.init({name: 'mydata'}, {foo: 'bar', x: 0});
    alert(Cookie.getData('foo'));
    

### A Few Sweet Spots

I wanted all the cookie variables to be stored in a single cookie. The class does allow you to still make independent Cookies. In order to store data, I would need some format to store my Cookie data. What better than JSON, and Prototype has a `toJSON` method.

I also wanted to encapsulate the cookie data. Plus since I was storing the cookie data as a Hash, I may have future changes. So the `getData`, `setData` accessor methods can be used for data management. And In *Rails-esk* fashion, I auto-save the cookie at the end of `setData`.

Finally, the Cookie auto-loads or is auto-created depending on the name passed to `init`. It will look in `document.cookie` and if it doesn't exist it will create a cookie with the settings provided. Finally, it loads the cookie data.

### In Closing

Prototype did not natively extend JavaScript with a Cookie object. However, by leveraging a few other classes, and the scripts mentioned above, I came up with a quick solution. Given, this class does not contain everything and could benefit from a code review. In the future, I may revisit the loading and possibly build some convenience methods to allow `Cookie['key']` instead of `Cookie.getData('key')`. Yet for what it does in 60 lines, it is more than able to handle my front-end needs.
