I held my first of a series of [Workshops by JMac](https://workshopsbyjmac.com) yesterday on *Writing Clean Code*. I plan to edit and release a recording of the workshop over the weekend. In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the references I made during the workshop.

- [*Implementation Patterns*](https://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091) by Kent Beck
  Filled with principles and practices focused on improving code readability. The first few chapters provide *motivation* for adopting these practices. The remainder of the book contains code samples. It's also the origin of the quote: *"We read code more than we write code"*. For me, this has become the single, biggest motivation for writing clean code.

- [*Hunting for great names in programming*](https://m.signalvnoise.com/hunting-for-great-names-in-programming-16f624c8fc03) by DHH
  Naming things is hard. This post takes us on the journey to find a name which communicates intent. DHH leaves us some breadcrumbs to do so ourselves. While it may seem excessive, taking this journey will improve your vocabulary of names. After just a few times, you'll notice naming things isn't so hard.

- [*Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers*](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/7-ineffective-coding-habits) by Kevlin Henney
  Watch this and if you're not convinced to write clean code, please check your pulse. Kevlin crushes common coding habits with researched examples and straight talk. While he mentions a few practices, the focus is mainly on exposing these *ineffective* habits. Similar to *Implementation Patterns*, this continually motivates me to refine my coding habits.

I plan to host *Part 2* of the *Writing Clean Code* series Wednesday, September 13th. [Sign up now](https://workshopsbyjmac.com) to secure your spot for this free, one hour workshop where I'll demo practices for writing clean code.
