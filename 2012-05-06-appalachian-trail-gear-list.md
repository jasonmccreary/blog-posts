The following is a complete gear list for my 14-day hike through the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail. Without water, my pack weighted 43lbs. I chose to only resupply once. So I carried a 7-day food supply. Otherwise, I imagine my pack could have been under 40lbs.

*   Camping Towel
*   iPhone
*   Solar Charger
*   Chattahoochee, Nantahala, and Smokey Mountain Park Maps
*   Relevant Pages from 2012 Appalachian Trail Data Book

After a week on the Appalachian Trail, I sent the following items home:

*   Columbia Hiking Pant
*   Under Armour HeatGear Shortsleeve
*   SmartWool Midweight Hiking Sock
*   Solar Lamp
*   Flint Striker
*   Half of the First-Aid Kit
*   Travel Sunscreen
*   Solar Charger (it rained most of my trip)
*   Maps and Data Book pages for completed sections

In addition, I did not take all of my dehydrated meals from my resupply. Instead I bought some lightweight items such as tortillas, snack crackers, tuna packs, and summer sausage. I noticed other hikers with such food. At first, I thought they were inexperienced. But it turns out these items are not only lighter but have higher calories while being more appetizing. Both of which are welcome after a long day of hiking.

I definitely could have gone lighter. 40lbs is my upper limit. Without the tent, large food supply, and additional gear I likely would have been under 35lbs. However, I preferred sleeping in my tent and avoiding town saved time and money.
