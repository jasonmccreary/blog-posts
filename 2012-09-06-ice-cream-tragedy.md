description: While waiting at the airport as a child my sweet tooth led to an ice cream tragedy.
---
I have a sweet tooth. A bottomless appetite for cookies, brownies, and ice cream.

When I was little we were waiting at the airport for my Uncle. I spotted an ice cream stand across the way. I wanted ice cream.

My Mom gave me some money and said, &ldquo;Go get something.&rdquo;

I remember being at the counter. Eyes wide looking at the menu. While I understood cost, I had no idea of how it related to portion size. I spotted the *Triple Scoop Ice Cream Sunday* and I had enough money. It came with all the toppings: hot fudge, caramel, whip cream, nuts. This thing was as big as my head. Welcome to heaven *Jashon*.

As I&rsquo;m walking back I felt everyone looking at me. I'm presenting this 10,000 calorie monstrosity for everyone to see. Just smiling my way through hell. Then I see my Mom&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Jason!&rdquo;

I was so embarrassed.

I didn&rsquo;t eat a single bite. It just sat there and melted. A goddamn ice cream tragedy.

To this day I still feel bad. Poor littleÂ *Triple Scoop Ice Cream Sunday.*
