So many people seem to forget a key component of problem solving â€“ root cause analysis. How can a problem be solved if you don&rsquo;t understand it? Nonetheless,  
in our fast paced society, under the pressure of immediacy the *just get it done* mentality reigns. You see it wrapped in wire and covered with duct tape. You hear it in expressions. Treating the symptom, not the problem. Can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees. You notice it in behavior. Denial. Excuses.

This is backward to me. I have an analytic mind. It has taken me a while to channel my thought processes, and I am still dialing in. But over the years, it has helped me major in Computer Science and minor in Philosophy and Psychology. It compliments my current profession as a developer. Although exhausting at times, it is a great benefit. 

Well armed I have become proficient at hunting down the root cause of problems. To me, root cause analysis is the most important step in solving a problem and an indicator of a [good developer][1]. So much energy is wasted when solutions are formed without this step. You are merely proposing something unproven and based on a limited understanding. Yes, maybe your solution works. But does it last? Did it just mask the problem? Did it create a new problem? Can this solution be applied to the same problem again? Did you just get lucky?

You don&rsquo;t have to break out your lab coat and microscope. But invest a few extra minutes next time you are presented with a problem. I have found those few minutes pay dividends later. Either by saving time or adding experience, in the end it feels right.
